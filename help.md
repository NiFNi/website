## FAQ
1. I lost my phone with Canoe on it, how do I get my Nano back? Can the thief steal my Nano?

**Answer:** You can install Canoe on another phone (or computer) and restore your wallet by either importing the seed which you should have on paper somewhere, or importing a backup file of the wallet if you have one of those. If you used a properly hard password the thief should not be able to access your Nano. If you are worried that the password was not that good, you can create a new wallet as well as restoring the old one, and then transfer all Nanos over from the old wallet to the new wallet. This way the old accounts do not have any funds in them any more.
