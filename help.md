##### How can I get help?

Canoe is a community driven open source project, the best way to find help is through:

* Ask on the community chat on [discord](https://discord.gg/ecVcJM3).

* Look in our [github issue tracker](http://github.com/getcanoe/canoe/issues) to see if the problem is already described there including any help around it.

##### Is the Canoe Wallet secure?

Security is our first concern. You can read a full article here: [Security in Canoe Beta](https://getcanoe.io/2018/02/11/security-in-beta.html).

##### I lost my phone with Canoe on it, how do I get my Nano back? Can someone steal my Nano?

You can install Canoe on another phone (or computer) and restore your wallet by either importing the seed (you backed up your seed right?) , or importing a backup file of the wallet if you have one of those. A backup file can be generated from Canoe's settings menu. 

If you set a complex password, you should be safe from others stealing your Nano. In the case you are worried that your password wasn't complex enough, you can restore your old wallet, and transfer all your Nano to a newer wallet (choose a better password this time!)

##### What is a representative and why should I choose one?

The network votes on the validity of unclear transactions, a representative will vote on your behalf. Choosing a representative that you trust is important, but also choosing a representative that doesn't have the majority of the voting weight (Official Reps) is important as it enhances the decentralization of the Nano network.

When no action is taken Canoe’s node is your representative.

More information about representatives can be found here//todo

##### My funds are not displayed correctly when compared to explorers!

Go to Preferences → Advanced and choose “Repair”.

Repairing your wallet could take some time, this will reload all blockchains associated with your wallet.

##### Can I use the same wallet (seed) and its’s accounts on different devices (e.g. mobile and desktop)?

It’s possibile, but we recommend using different wallets for different devices. Using the same wallet across devices could lead to your wallet going out of sync. You will need to "Repair" your wallet to get it in-sync.

##### I want to backup my address book.

Go to Preferences → Export Wallet - this will export all settings, accounts and addressbook entries.

##### I have imported my wallet using the seed, where are my other accounts I created?

You can recreate your accounts by clicking the + button on homepage. A seed contains all associated accounts in the same order, you will always be able to restore them.

##### What is ‘Server Side POW’?

Every transaction needs to perform a calculation as a security mechanism. Desktop applications generally have no problem with this, however mobile devices would require a lot of processing power and energy, therefore it is disabled on these devices.
