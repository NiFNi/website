        <title>Disaster Girl Strikes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night we decided to release the Alpha version of Canoe. We however opted not to send out emails to those who shown interest in the public alpha; we wanted to test it on a smaller crowd. The launch was announced to our small folowership on Twitter and on the Raiblocks Discord. This proved wise since Disaster Girl from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getcanoe.io/2018/01/08/canoe-first-mobile-wallet-for-raiblocks.html&quot;&gt;alpha release blog post&lt;/a&gt; showed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-bug&quot;&gt;A Bug&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alpha of Canoe worked quite nicely from a UI perspective, a few people got cracking with it, all was fine. At some point, a new user clicked through the onboarding suddenly failed hard. Despite that the two calls had worked perfectly fine for about 114 wallets. In fact, immediately after the “wallet create” call the &lt;em&gt;rai_node&lt;/em&gt; decided that the wallet was locked. It then just threw it’s digital hands in the air and refused to talk to us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I stumbled onto a bug in _rai/_node. rai_node this is core code, so I did not look deep into it. Colin proposed that it may be a race condition and that a pause between the first two calls might help - but nope. Another suggestion was that the latest master has some bug fixes preventing some bad conditions, nope, didn’t help either. Help arrived later with Luke Alonso, finding the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;helicopter-down&quot;&gt;Helicopter Down&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a flurry of attempts trying to get the _rai_node running again, I gave up. The server was down and none could run Canoe at this point. The team and I decided to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scan all wallets to see if anyone had any money in them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reach out to wallet owners and try to figure out how to give them back their funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete all empty wallets and see if it could be reserructed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;luke-saves-the-day&quot;&gt;Luke Saves The Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Alonso contacted me after I had explained our problems on the #development channel. He had been hacking in these parts earlier, and fixed another nasty issue causing corruption in a similar fashion. Luke took the db and debugged it all and found out that &lt;strong&gt;there is a limit of 128 wallets&lt;/strong&gt; in _rai_node! Now, a limit would be fine - if _rai_node actually would return an error saying something like “limit reached.” What where is fun that? ;) The bug was simply that the code didn’t detect failure nor report it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have patched our rai_node with a limit of 1000 wallets, and we are up and running again. If this stays up for a while we will soon send out our email to all those 600 that signed up for the alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;next-step&quot;&gt;Next Step&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are already hacking on the newer architecture, which will not use any of these calls. Until then, play with the alpha but remember the warnings we have given about it. The beta will be a much more solid solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being part of this project at such an early stage. If you’d like to contribute to Canoe, you can help us by reporting issues, fixing bugs, translating, or donating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once more… THANK YOU LUKE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards, the Canoe Team&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Canoe Wallet&amp;#58; First Mobile Wallet for RaiBlocks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we started working on a new wallet for Raiblocks based on the popular Bitcoin wallet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://copay.io&quot;&gt;Copay&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we are happy to bring you our first tech preview alpha release of Canoe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canoe supports &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt; (to be released, but you can build it yourself) and &lt;strong&gt;Windows Phone&lt;/strong&gt; (also comes soon), in addition to &lt;strong&gt;Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux desktops&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are releasing Canoe early because we want to get it in the hands of the community as soon as possible in order to test the user experience and help us ‘battle harden’ it. That being said, Canoe comes with a solid list of features including an onboarding tour that creates the wallet, importing seeds, sending and receiving RaiBlocks (QRCode), creating multiple accounts, QR code scanning, an address book, fingerprint unlock, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be aware that Canoe is still in it’s very early stages, so please use only accounts with small amounts for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a non-exhaustive list of Canoe’s current shortcomings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password protection is not yet implemented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email notifications is not yet hooked in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The account view with transactions is not yet implemented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can currently not remove an account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URL handling is not yet done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The home tab with balances and pending is not updated automatically, pull down or switch between tabs to get it up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Import wallet via file not implemented&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currency conversions not fully working, but a bit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…and a bunch more of course!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of the above will of course soon be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security of the current model is based on people trusting us to not steal their money. Kinda like any exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because the current architecture relies on the “wallet” parts of the RPC, which means Canoe is sending the seed (when you import, or when you create the wallet initially) through HTTPS to our server. So if a hacker gets root access to our servers, they can do some serious damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also haven’t yet implemented the password mechanism, and currently client side state (including seed) is stored in localstorage unencrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all &lt;strong&gt;big fat security issues&lt;/strong&gt; that we plan to fix in the beta release by reusing the excellent raiwallet webclient side codebase which addresses most of these issues brilliantly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we are doing server side PoW, so… if a LOT of people start using it - the server will not manage. We are not sure what number “a LOT” is. Again, something that will be moved to client side in beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;contribute&quot;&gt;Contribute&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being part of this project at such an early stage. If you’d like to contribute to Canoe, you can help us by reporting issues, fixing bugs, translating, or donating.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Canoe Is Born</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started looking into crypto currencies at the beginning of December around one month ago. Buying some Bitcoin and learning the ropes. But I immediately started looking at the “mining free” coins, since IMHO it’s an obviously idiotic waste of energy going on with the whole mining concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dags&quot;&gt;The DAGs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As so called “DAG coins” eliminate mining - RaiBlocks, IOTA and Byteball caught my attention. Of these three, RaiBlocks felt most interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byteball does have some nice features, and from the little I have read, a concept of privacy making it stand out. But RaiBlocks is straight forward in its focus (money - not a damn “computing platform”) and I would also argue the block lattice model feels very natural to me; so natural that I can’t understand why blockchains have been around all this time, and only RaiBlocks picked such a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source&quot;&gt;Open Source&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a developer, quite experienced, and I wanted to get involved in the community somehow. I have taken part in many different open source projects during the years and that’s how I like to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly… RaiBlocks has in my humble opinion a bit of learning to do in this department. The core team is fairly silent and things are being developed “out of sight”. I understand that there are probably commercial reasons for some things being “cooked up” in the dark, but it does make the community “second class citizens”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell we have no real saying in what’s being done nor how the roadmap is supposed to look. Maybe I am missing something here though, perhaps I am just old-fashion, perhaps there are channels open that I should have known about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many praise the team for actually delivering though and not just talking, and I agree, that’s a strong point - but hey, that’s what real developers do and I expect no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I would expect a bit more inclusiveness. If it’s supposed to be a real open source project of course. Sorry for sounding negative, but this is meant to be constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wallets&quot;&gt;Wallets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously RaiBlocks is a bit lacking in this department. The native official wallet uses Qt, written in C++ and works, but… it’s definitely not a pillar of user friendliness - and that’s perfectly fine - because core team has their focus on other parts. As long as it works, it serves the purpose. Of course, it should be slightly less confusing around the important parts (backup, seed etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web based &lt;a href=&quot;http://raiwallet.com&quot;&gt;Raiwallet.com&lt;/a&gt; is good stuff. I don’t use it myself, but I have skimmed lots of the code. In fact, we plan to reuse large parts of it in Canoe for the beta!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are some works in progress, but definitely a bit of a shortage here. So feeling that “hey, how hard can it be?” - I looked at Byteball, because people said they have a great wallet and it turns out that it’s a derivation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://copay.io&quot;&gt;Copay&lt;/a&gt; from Bitpay. These wallets are built using web tech - in Cordova and nwjs. That means great portability including mobile. And it’s all MIT licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;just-doing-it&quot;&gt;Just doing it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I have learned is that things get going when you actually start doing something instead of talking. So I just cloned out Byteball and started with it. That failed, I couldn’t even run it! Not sure what it was, but after a few hours of frustration (probably something trivial) I cloned out Copay instead, going straight to the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point in time I have been hacking on it like a mad man, and @Eunji and @rami have joined up helping me with design, UI fixing, testing, planning and website development. I called it RaiW first, but @Eunji came up with the much better name Canoe and the first incarnation of our logo - a canoe holding a rai stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have even gotten our first real donation! No idea from whom, but thanks! We split it among all team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-canoe-project&quot;&gt;The Canoe Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fired up a server, registered a domain, got a website in place and so on. And we are close to our first tech-preview &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;alpha release&lt;/a&gt;. That’s after just a few weeks of work, and Canoe is already full of working features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the current backend model is not good from a security perspective, we will start replacing it as soon as alpha is out the door. But we want people to get a shot at playing with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we have over 600 people signed up to try out the alpha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;contribute&quot;&gt;Contribute&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite anyone to contribute to Canoe. You can help us by joining as developer, reporting issues, fixing bugs, translating, chatting encouraging words on discord - or donating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true Open Source. Everyone can be a part. Everything done in the open. :)&lt;/p&gt;
