Work continues on the dev branch for the upcoming Beta, and progress is good. We hope to make the first release of the Beta available during february, but we do not have a date yet.

But the time has come to **shut down the Alpha release**. If you have used, or is using the Alpha - **this is very important to read**.

<!--more-->

# The Shutdown
Without going into technicalities, the wallets that the Alpha release creates are based on trusting us and our server. That means that now that we soon are cancelling the Alpha test period, we want you to:

* **Transfer all your Nano** that you have in the Canoe alpha to another wallet
* **Never again use the seed** that was used in the Canoe alpha wallet

There are users that at the time of writing have **more than 10 Nano** in the Canoe Alpha, some has substantially more, and we really just want your Nano to be safe.

* In one week, on 9th february, **we will halt the Canoe Alpha**.
* If you haven't moved your Nanos to other accounts by then, and you really need us to give you a second chance, then you will have to **email us at hello@getcanoe.io and ask us to reopen**.
* One week later, if no emails have asked us to reopen, we will nuke the wallets from our server - in fact - **we will delete the whole rai_node**.
* If someone has asked us to reopen, we will do so from **16th february to 19th february**. Then after that we will delete. For sure. Delete. Gone.

If you still haven't moved your funds after the above you can still of course use the seed (which you of course have on paper or something) to access your accounts from any other wallet.

BUT... we really ask you to then move the funds out of these accounts and **not use that seed anymore**. Do not keep using this seed in another wallet.

If you have questions you can always reach us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ecVcJM3).

Thank you, the Canoe team
