Work continues on the dev branch for the upcoming Beta, and progress is good. We hope to make the first release of the Beta available during february, we however do not have a date set yet.

That said, the time has come to **shut down the Alpha release**. If you have used, or are using the Alpha - then please take the time to read this blogpost.  **This is very important to read**.

# The Shutdown
Without going into technicalities, the wallets that the Alpha release creates are based on trusting us and our server. It always been our intention to phase out the Alpha release, and we have communicated this very clearly. The time for sunsetting the alpha is approaching, and if you used Canoe Alpha, you need to do the following: 

* **Transfer all your Nano** that you have in the Canoe alpha to another wallet. We recommend [Nano Wallet](https://nanowallet.io/)
* **Never again use the seed** that was used in the Canoe alpha wallet

At the time of writing, there are some users who have **more than 10 Nano** in Canoe Alpha, some substantially more. We really want to make sure your Nano are sage.

* On the 9th February, **we will halt the Canoe Alpha**. That means you will not have access to your Nano.
* If you haven't moved your Nano to another accounts, then you will have to **email us at hello@getcanoe.io and ask us to reopen**.
* A week later, we will nuke the wallets from our server - in fact - **we will delete the whole rai_node**.
* If someone has asked us to reopen, we will do so from **16th february to 19th february**. Then after that we will delete. For sure. Delete. Gone.
* Between the **16th and 19th of February** we will accept reopen requests. Then we will delete all wallets. Gone. Nada.

If you still haven't moved your funds after the above dates, you can still of course use the seed (which you of course have on paper right?) to access your accounts from any other wallet.

BUT... we really ask you to then move the funds out of these accounts and **not use that seed anymore**. Do not keep using this seed in another wallet.

It pains us to this, but we have repeatedly stressed that the Alpha is for testing and not use amounts you are not comfortable with losing. We hope you understand that these funds create a liability on the Canoe team in terms of securing your funds that we never intended to bear. We **implore you to take action ASAP!** 

If you have questions you can always reach us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ecVcJM3).

Thank you, the Canoe team.
